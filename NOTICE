The following modifications were made to the code:

- The code in lcp_physics/lcp was updated to work with more recent pytorch versions based on the qpth repository at
  https://github.com/locuslab/qpth/tree/bc121d59802d43fc6cbd685959e9156030dc1baf, licensed under the Apache License,
  Version 2.0 (see LICENSE). These updates were performed by Rama Krishna Kandukuri, rama.kandukuri@tuebingen.mpg.de,
  Embodied Vision Group, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
- The file lcp_physics/physics/utils.py has an additional default parameter SOLVER=1 for working with the changes in
  lcp_physics/lcp.
- The file lcp_physics/physics/world.py was updated to include the time-of-contact differential.
- The files lcp_physics/physics/{bodies.py,constraints.py} were updated to transfer pytorch tensors to CPU before
  converting them to numpy arrays.
